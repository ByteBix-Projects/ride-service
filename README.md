The Ride Service is a core microservice managing ride requests, fare estimation, and ride lifecycle states in the ride-booking system.

## Key Features
- Ride Request Handling
- Fare Estimation
- Ride Lifecycle Management

## Recommended Tech Stack
- **Runtime**: Go for high performance and scalability in handling ride logic [1][5].
- **Framework**: DropWizard or custom Go frameworks for business logic [4].
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational ride data storage [1][4].
- **Mapping API**: Google Maps API for distance and ETA calculations [2][4].

## System Design Structure
